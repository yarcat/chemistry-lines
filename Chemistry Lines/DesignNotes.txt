View/Presentation
=================

FieldPresentation
-----------------
 - Knows field structure -- sizes and cell locations.
 - Converts screen coordinates to cell index and vice versa.
 - Displays the field.

GameView
----------------------------------
 - It is supposed to be an android's View.
 - Uses FieldPresentation for handling View.onDraw().
 - Transfers android's MotionEvents to Motion CellTouchEvents.
   In android's terms it is View.OnTouchListener.

PresentationController
----------------------
 - Field-User Interaction *State*.  E.g. knows about selected cells.
   - Provides cell highlighting information to FieldPresentation.
 - Provides animations.
 
MotionLogic e.g. field-user interaction.
----------------------------------------
 - Listens all motion notifications (in field coordinates)
 - Knows state related to a move. E.g. selected source and destination cells
 - Notifies PresentationController
 - Asks GameLogic whether this particular move is possible
 - Commands GameLogic to make a move


Game Rules
==========

Field (model)
-------------
 - integer indexed cell storage
 - provides connections between cells
  
Path
----
 - performs reach-ability tests
   - one cell to another (implemented)
   - one cell to all others (planned)
 - builds path from one cell to another (planned)

ChemistryLogic
--------------
 - implements chemistry compounds and reaction rules
 
GameLogic
---------
 - Checks if a move is possible -- reach-ability and reactions
 - Make a move.  E.g. updates the field and interacts to PresentationController.
 - Adds new items to the field.
